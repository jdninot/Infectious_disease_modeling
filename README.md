# COVID-19 Modeling Project
## Description
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is one of the most significant global health crises of the 21st century. It has led to widespread social, economic, and healthcare challenges, emphasizing the importance of robust epidemiological modeling to understand and predict its progression.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project is provided by the National Institute of Health (INS) of Colombia.

## Models
This project combines two powerful approaches to model the dynamics of COVID-19:

Markov Chains for stochastic modeling of disease progression.
Neural Networks for capturing complex, non-linear relationships in the data.
This repository aims to offer insights into the pandemic's evolution in Colombia and explore advanced methodologies for epidemiological research.
